# What is This?
This is a game engine for a 2d game. It is fully open source and all dependencies are open source (above the kernel ofcourse)
It is written in c++ and it uses sdl to manage windows and opengl. It is a work in progress but it can load .obj files and rudementary
map files.

# What Needs to be done?
Proper physics needs to be implemented and an UI needs to be implemented.
